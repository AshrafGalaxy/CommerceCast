## 🚀 Key Features Showcase

### 1. Executive Dashboard

Get a pulse on your business in real-time. The dashboard aggregates data from multiple sources to track vital KPIs like Revenue, Gross Margin, and Customer Lifetime Value (CLV).

**Key Metrics Tracked:**

* **Total Revenue & Net Profit**: Real-time financial health monitoring.
* **Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)**: Predictive analytics to identify high-value customer segments.
* **Churn Rate Analysis**: Early warning system for customer attrition.
* **Inventory Velocity**: Tracking how fast stock moves to optimize capital.

### 2. Advanced AI Forecasting

Stop guessing the future. Our hybrid ensemble engine uses a weighted model of three advanced algorithms:

* **Prophet**: Handles seasonality (weekly/yearly cycles) and holiday effects.
* **XGBoost**: Captures complex, non-linear trends and feature interactions (e.g., price vs. volume).
* **ARIMA**: Models linear dependencies and short-term trends.
* **Ensemble Logic**: Dynamically weights predictions based on historical accuracy (MAPE) for maximum precision 30-90 days out.

### 3. Inventory Intelligence

Never run out of stock or hold dead inventory again. CommerceCast uses automated tiered classification:

* **ABC Analysis**: Automatically segments products into A (High Value), B (Medium), and C (Low Value) tiers based on the Pareto Principle.
* **Smart Reorder Points**: dynamic thresholds calculated using Lead Time Demand + Safety Stock.
* **Stock Status**: Real-time classification into "Overstock", "Healthy", and "Low Stock" with specific action recommendations (e.g., "Run Promotion" for Overstock).

### 4. Promotion Simulator

Don't launch promotions blindly. Our simulator allows you to A/B test strategies before they go live.

* **Elasticity Modeling**: Uses Price Elasticity of Demand ($E=1.5$) to predict volume lift.
* **ROI Calculator**: Accurately forecasts Revenue Impact, Margin/Profit changes, and Net ROI.
* **Scenario Planning**: Compare a 10% discount vs. a 20% discount side-by-side.

### 5. Sales Comparison

Analyze performance across periods or benchmarks with precision.

* **Time Travel Analysis**: Compare any two date ranges (e.g., "This Month vs. Last Month") to spot growth trends.
* **Competitor Benchmarking**: Upload external CSV data to compare your sales against competitor benchmarks or industry standards.
* **Metric Delta**: Automatic calculation of percentage change for Revenue, Units Sold, and Average Order Value (AOV).
